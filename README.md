# README

Demo version of the crypto exchange.
Using this application, it is possible to create a bitcoin address on the `testnet` network and use this address to exchange from `USDT` to `BTC`, calculating the commission of the exchanger itself and taking into account the commission of miners (fixed). The current exchange rate is obtained from the public API (according to the schedule and also manually). The balance of a bitcoin address is updated automatically, as well as with each exchange operation.

      curl -fsSL <https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg> | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
      echo \ "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] <https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu> \
      $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

* Install Docker Engine

      sudo apt-get update
      sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
